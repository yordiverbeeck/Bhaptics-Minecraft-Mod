# Bhaptics-Minecraft-Mod
A bhaptics minecraft mod!

This is a dev POC for forge version 1.16.5. There is no release available yet.

The POC connects to the bHaptics Player, registers tacts files and plays them upon the user being hurt. 
The cool part so far is that the tact changes orientation with the user's perspective upon being hurt.

It currently only works in a singleplayer environment and the connection to bhaptics is made from server-side (which is obviousbly bad practice).
The client-server communication is still in the works. For the simple reasen that I don't know how it works yet.

Pull requests and other comments are very welcome!
