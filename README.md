# Bhaptics-Minecraft-Mod
A bhaptics minecraft mod!

This is only a dev POC for forge version 1.16.1. There is no release yet as this is still in development.

It currently only works in singleplayer, because to define the type of damage (fall damage, entity,...), you need some events that aren't available client's side afaik.
